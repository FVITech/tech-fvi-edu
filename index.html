                    <p>Our in-person Computer Programming courses are designed for busy adults driven to change their career and/or boost their professional skills. Few other Web Developer Schools offer the length and breadth of material that we do.</p>
                    <p>We are a Computer Programming School devoted to creating Application Developers with sound Computer Science skills. Our curriculum is designed to be completed in a dense, but realistic time frame of nine months.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the 9-month program, each student will have created their own portfolio full of web applications, something which university graduates lack and employers desperately seek.</p>

                    <h4>Weeks 1-6: Foundations of Front-end Programming.</h4>
                    <p>During the first 6 weeks, we wil introduce you to each of the main skills you need in order to become a front-end Programmer. You will learn HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Git, Ajax programming, and build tools (Browserify, npm and Gulp).</p>
                    <h4>Weeks 7-15: Advanced Front-end Programming</h4>
                    <p>Our faculty of real industry pros takes you through more advanced front-end development techniques in an environment of project-based learning. You will learn techniques for using gradients, HTML5 media, HTML5 canvas, CSS transforms and
                        perspective, and lots of event-driven and AJAX programming.</p>
                    <h4>Weeks 16-21: Back-end Programming</h4>
                    <p>You will build at least 6 full stack (both front-end and back-end) applications using NodeJS on the server side and MongoDB or SQL for the database.</p>
                    <h4>Weeks 22-36: AngularJS, php and Beyond</h4>
                    <p>During this last stretch, you will learn AngularJS, ReactJS, php, and become a WordPress pro. We we say WordPress, we're not talking about clicking around a GUI and installing themes; we're talking about harnessing the WordPress codex to build real database-driven
                        apps on the back of WordPress. You will also learn Computer Science fundamentals and advanced Git techniques.</p>

                    <h4>Coding Bootcamps</h4>
                    <p>The South Florida region offers only a handful of coding bootcamps, including <a target="_blank" href="https://wyncode.co/">Wyncode</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ironhack.com/en/web-development-bootcamp">Ironhack</a>. These programs are often effective, but they take place during the work day and cost  $9,000 - $12,000.</p>
                    <p>FVI's technology programs take place during the evenings and therefore don't interfere with the 9-5 career schedule, all for a third of the cost of bootcamps.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, the coding bootcamps last 320 total hours while FVI's program lasts 720 hours. We think 320 hours is barely enough time to become a web developer, let alone a strong one. There are no shortcuts--you will become a strong web developer by the end of our program.</p>
                    <h4>Computer Science Degrees from Universities</h4>
                    <p>A computer science degree will give you an excellent understanding of computers and the internet, but you won't have any coding skills to apply your knowledge. You won't have a portoflio of projects proving you can make stuff.</p>
                    <p>A developer's portfolio is the most important part of their resume. By the end of FVI's web developer program, you will have a rich portfolio full of varied, in-depth, relevant projects.</p>
                    <h4>Online Programs</h4>
                    <p>There are a few different online coding schools and websites that can take a beginner from amateur to intermediate at a low cost, and often for free. For example, <a target="_blank" href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> provides many good introductions to various programming languages for free, <a target="_blank" href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Team Tree House</a> provides learning paths with videos and exercises for a low monthly fee, and <a target="_blank" href="http://coursera.org">Coursera</a> provides a few online computer science courses from excellent universities, for free.</p>
                    <p>However, online programs are notorious for <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=JvfZDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA24&dq=mooc+completion+rates&ots=lUaqVHHaY1&sig=anAMbrl1dAW98oA_ysNeVcTss30#v=onepage&q=mooc%20completion%20rates&f=false" >low completion rates</a>. As a student in FVI's web developer program, you will be learning and coding with a professional web developer in the same room who can immediately answer any questions, look at your code, and offer you feedback and encouragement. Such a close student-mentor relationship cannot be found in online programs.</p>
