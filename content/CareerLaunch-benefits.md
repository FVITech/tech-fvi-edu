In a world of ever-changing technology, many businesses find that they use a large array of tools and have some "hidden" complexities in their operations. This makes the hiring process extra-challenging because in many cases, candidates have several gaps in their knowledge. At TechLaunch, we pride ourselves in constantly engaging the local job market for feedback and refining our curriculum to provide our Launchees (graduates) with the real, tangible, relevant skills that they will need in the actual day-to-day work. You won't find any of our Launchees unable to upload files to an FTP server.

## Opportunity to Have an Impact

Many companies and individuals in the tech ecosystem are very socially conscious. We all know about the skills gap, the digital divide, and the under-representation of minorities and certain socioeconomic strata in the world of tech. At TechLaunch, we serve the underserved - most of our student body are minorities of limited economic means. By hiring our grads, you have the opportunity to personally or institutionally effect change for the better and narrow the divide in the world of tech.

By seizing the opportunity to hire from a diverse applicant pool companies may benefit from a diversity of backgrounds and ideas.

## Culture of Learning

The foremost skill we teach our students is to be *life-long learners.* By hiring our Launchees (graduates) and allowing them to grow within your organization, you will help foster a culture of teaching, learning, and collaboration amongst your team members. This oftentimes result in engaged, loyal employees who want to "pay it forward.""

## Not Just Anybody Can Launch

Not just anyone who can take an eight week vacation can graduate from TechLaunch. Our students have to undergo a rigorous assessment process before enrolling. Furthermore, the majority of TechLaunch grads stick through nine months of 25+ hours a week of coding while holding down full time jobs.

In the fast-moving world of tech, it is now more important than ever to achieve team cohesion. It doesn't matter how great of an engineer you are if you can't work as a team, and we make sure our Launchees know this. Throughout our program, we spend a significant amount of time with our students fostering the essential values that we believe make for an ideal team player: humility, ambition, and interpersonal intelligence. Our emphasis on soft skills helps our grads fit into the world of tech.

## Your Resident Zero-Cost Recruiter

Our career services department has the mission of working with our hiring partners in order to understand their corporate culture, business needs, and technology stack. Our team is dedicated to helping our hiring partners find a good fit amongst our graduates, if there is one.

In some cases, where there is an experience or tech stack mismatch, some hiring partners have found it helpful to engage Launchees in temp-to-perm opportunities, paid internships, or unpaid internships. We work with our hiring partners to help them fill their talent needs while minimizing business risk.
